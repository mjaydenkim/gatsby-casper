#Here are some interesting facts about Osmium:

1. The discovery of Osmium is linked to the discovery of Platinum, since osmium is the black residue left over after platinum is dissolved in aqua regia.
2. Osmium is the rarest of all stable elements, it is found at 0.05 parts per billion in Earth's crust.
3. Osmium is very rare and expensive, and Osmium powder is sold for $1300 per kilogram. 
4. It is highly toxic in its pure form, and is therefore usually alloyed.
5. Osmium was used in early lightbulbs but was replaced after a few years by tungsten.
