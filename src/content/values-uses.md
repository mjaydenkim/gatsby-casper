# How do people use Osmium?

*Osmium is mostly used in alloys.
  *It is very rare and expensive as well as toxic. 
*Hard Osmium alloys are used in pen tips, instrument pivots, needles, electrical contacts, and other places where frictional contact should be minimized.
*It is also used in the chemical industry as a catalyst.
*Osmium-Platinum is used in surgical instruments and pacemakers due to its inertness.
*OsO4 (Osmium Tetroxide) is highly volatile and beneficial in the chemical industry.
  *OsO4 is also used for staining biological samples for microscopic examination and fingerprint detection.
