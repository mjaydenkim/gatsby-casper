Osmium is bluish-white and shiny. Its melting point is 3033째C (5491째F) and its boiling point is 5027째C (9080째F). Its density is 22.5g per cubic centimeter. These numbers are the highest of the platinum-group metals, and among the highest of all the elements. <br/>
Osmium is different from other metals in that it cannot be melted or shaped, and is unworkable.
